**Relational databases**: These databases store data in tables with defined relationships between them. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

**NoSQL databases**: These databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility and scalability. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.

**Graph databases**: These databases are optimized for storing and querying data that consists of nodes and edges, such as social networks or recommendation systems. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

**Time-series databases**: These databases are optimized for storing and retrieving time-stamped data, such as sensor readings or financial data. Examples include InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.

**Object-oriented databases**: These databases store data in objects and provide features like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Examples include OrientDB and Couchbase.

**Key-value stores**: These databases store data as key-value pairs and are often used for simple data storage and retrieval. Examples include Redis and Memcached.

**Document databases**: These databases store data in JSON-like documents and provide flexible schema design. Examples include MongoDB and CouchDB.

Each type of database has its own strengths and use cases, so the choice of database depends on the specific requirements of the application.
